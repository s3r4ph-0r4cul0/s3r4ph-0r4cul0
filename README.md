## 👾 About Me

I'm a **Cybersecurity professional focused on offensive security**, with hands-on experience in **pentesting, red teaming and vulnerability research**.  
My work is centered on identifying real-world attack paths, exploiting weaknesses, and translating technical risk into actionable remediation.

I actively work with **network and web application pentesting**, Active Directory attacks, cloud security assessments, and automation for offensive operations.  
I enjoy building tooling, improving workflows, and diving deep into how systems fail under adversarial pressure.

Always open to collaboration on **security research, offensive tooling, labs, and CTF-style projects**.
